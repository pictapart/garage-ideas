Locate and pull the cord: Some security tips recommend using a zip tie or cutting your emergency release cord to eliminate the threat, but that greatly reduces your garage door safety.</p>
<h3 id="pull-the-cord-towards-the-interior-of-your-garage">Pull the cord towards the interior of your garage.</h3><p>Generally these are used on garage doors that do not have any other access points. More sophisticated intruders can circumvent these hacks by slipping a wire into the crack above your garage door and pulling down on the latch itself (which the cord pulls to activate the emergency release feature). Pull the handle away from the face of the door and spray a generous amount of lubricant on the inner mechanism. In some cases, the manual release may be fine but the springs may be stiff or corroded, making it too difficult for even a strong adult to lift up the heavy garage door. Ideal for garages that do not have any other access. The trolley sits on the opener carriage.</p>
