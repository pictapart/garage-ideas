<p>If the garage door was opening too quickly, move it to the next lower hole. Retest the door balance, as you did in step 1. Any door which appears to be labouring during the opening or closing operation may also require some qualified adjustment. The extension springs are evenly matched and installed to keep the garage door properly aligned so that it runs smoothly throughout the entire length of the track and closes evenly.</p>
<h3 id="first-check-the-sensor-lights">First, check the sensor lights:</h3><p>Once the battery is in place, test the transmitter, and if it works, replace the transmitter door. Sometimes objects can fall into the garage door mechanism which can jam doors and stop them moving completely. The problem is either due to a blocked path between the sensors, dirty eyes, loose wires at the sensors or at the motor head, or just bad sensors. To realign the track, first loosen the screws that hold the track to the frame. Once the battery is in place, test the transmitter, and if it works, replace the transmitter door. The transmitters (remotes) will not work to close the garage door.</p>
