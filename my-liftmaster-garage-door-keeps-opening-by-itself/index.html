Why Did My Liftmaster Garage Door Opening By Itself From daytonbands.com</p>
<p>If your garage door keeps opening by itself after you closed it, you may have to adjust your closed limit settings. If the remote opener is dirty or the batteries are failing, it may cause the door to open on its own. If you disable the opener, or simply unplug the opener�s power cord, make sure you know how to open the door manually in case of emergency such as fire. A power surge from a lightning strike or other electrical problem can cause the board to go bad, as well as the transformer.</p>
<h3 id="it-could-be-in-the-circuit-board-a-remote-the-wall-button-or-its-wiring-or-even-the-wired-keypad">It could be in the circuit board, a remote, the wall button or its wiring, or even the wired keypad.</h3><p>When your liftmaster garage door opener opens and closes by itself, here are the troubleshooting tips you need to follow. Reasons why your garage door keeps opening after closing. When your garage door opens or closes when you haven�t triggered the remote, one possible cause is that a neighbor�s remote was programmed at the same time as yours. If your garage door reverses when it hits the floor, look into these three common causes, and try troubleshooting the issue. But when the door begins to descend all on its own, the problem may point to the opener�s logic board or the circuitry inside the motor unit itself. Every garage door opener has a limit switch that controls where the door stops when it is lowered or raised.</p>
