<h3 id="if-you-are-familiar-with-some-basic-physics-you-know-that-metal-contracts-when-the-temperature-is-low">If you are familiar with some basic physics, you know that metal contracts when the temperature is low.</h3><p>A garage door that only opens a few inches might be the result of low garage remote batteries, blocked sensors, or defective springs.

It might be a great idea to replace your batteries. If your garage door feels heavy to lift manually, you likely have a broken spring. Though this problem should be obvious, it shouldn’t be overlooked.</p>
