<p>Garage doors make for a beautiful addition but when it comes to safety, you need to ensure that it’s in proper working order or suffer the most common garage door injuries like falling doors. If the garage door suddenly comes crashing down and will not go back up, this is usually the result of a snapped cable. When i screw the screws in it they aren�t very snug and then when i open it they immediately pop out because they cannot load that amount of weight. Depending on the weight of the garage door and the condition of the garage door tracks, if the force setting is too low, the garage door opener will have a difficult time lifting or dropping the garage door safely.</p>
<h3 id="your-helper-should-help-you-lift-the-door">Your helper should help you lift the door.</h3><p>I recently switched to genie led bulbs that are specifically designed for use in garage door openers and that completely elimated my problems and doubled the range too. Remove the top hinge from the door jamb revealing the flat mortised area of the jamb. If you suspect that your door may have dropped, then the easiest way to check is to measure corner to corner across the diagonals of the door, and verify that the measurements are near enough the same, or to within a couple of millimetres or so. I suspect the memory is bad on the logic board. If there is any obstruction in the doorway, the infrared beams will be interrupted and the garage door will not close. If the garage door suddenly comes crashing down and will not go back up, this is usually the result of a snapped cable.</p>
