<p>The majority of automatic garage doors have a manual release to control your door when there is no power. Most garage doors have a manual locking system which you can use to prevent unauthorized access to the garage. This will enable manual operation of the garage door because it is no longer attached to the opening mechanism. Choose a garage door opener with battery backup keeping power out situations in mind.</p>
<h3 id="when-there-is-no-power-you-must-first-ensure-that-the-garage-door-is-entirely-closed-before-you-try-anything">When there is no power, you must first ensure that the garage door is entirely closed before you try anything.</h3><p>This prevents the door from being pulled and opened. If the garage door is open when power is lost, ensure there is nothing in the way of the garage door path. Make sure to test the door using the remote. Pulling this red rope will release the trolley from the garage door track and enable you to use your door manually. You may also need to reset your garage door opener. The manual lock allows you to secure your garage door and everything in your garage, even in a power outage.</p>
