<p>After a lightning storm my genie intellicode garage door opener would not close unless i held the button on the wall panel. This could indicate a bad circuit board. A lightning strike can also fry your garage door opener’s hardwired controls, leaving you with little choice but to manually open and close the door until repairs are made. If your opener has been affected by lightning, then you may find that the device no longer powers on following a storm.</p>
<h3 id="i-have-a-genie-pro-13-hp-screw-drive">I have a genie pro 1/3 hp screw drive.</h3><p>Replacing the circuit board in a garage door opener is a complicated decision to make. The fire department came out and inspected the attic, and removed the antenna that was hit. If i purposefully misalign the sensors and try to open the garage door, the light will blink several times. The electrical circuits can be harmed by a power surge from a nearby lightning strike. The door has dislodged from its track. As for the shop lites checl the bulbs and make sure they did not vibrate out of position.</p>
