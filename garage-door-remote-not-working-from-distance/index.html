<p>It is controlled by remote control which people use from a short distance. If the distance is close ,it can normal use, but it can not be used if the distance is a little far away , the reason maybe is the remote control emits weak signal. Try using the remote from a safe distance again, before moving on to the next step. Look for the led on the opener to flash when you push a remote button.</p>
<h3 id="modern-garage-door-openers-are-essentially-small-radios-that-operate-at-about-315mh-and-a-few-feet-of-extra-distance-can-affect-the-signal">Modern garage door openers are essentially small radios that operate at about 315mh, and a few feet of extra distance can affect the signal.</h3><p>Modern garage door openers are essentially small radios that operate at about 315mh, and a few feet of extra distance can affect the signal. The antenna is a part of the door opener and it is responsible for receiving the signal. Due to the low battery power, long distance and obstacles, the transmitting signal intensity is relatively weak, you can increase the antenna length or replace the battery. Mostly, your garage door remote has a range of about 20 feet worth of distance from your overhead garage doors. Changing to a standard light bulb will fix the problem. Another common issue when working with a remote is issues with it pairing.</p>
